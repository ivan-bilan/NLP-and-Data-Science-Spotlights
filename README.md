# NLP and Data Science GitHub Repository Spotlight
Daily spotlights of some underrated NLP and Data Science GitHub repositories.

#### Spotlight №1
Topic Modelling approach called CorexTopic: https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic

CorexTopic, or to be more verbose, Anchored Correlation Explanation Topic Modeling is a form of topic modeling that you should use when you already more or less know the topics you are expecting to extract from the dataset. Using CorexTopic you can help the model make those topics more precise and elaborate by providing so-called anchor words. With this approach, your topic clusters will be more precise. Try it out, it's a huge time saver when it comes to Topic Modeling.

And since we are on the topic of Topic Modelling, also take a look at a similar approach called GuidedLDA: https://github.com/vi3k6i5/GuidedLDA

#### Spotlight №2
Keywords extraction library called YAKE: https://github.com/LIAAD/yake

When it comes to keyword extraction the first instinct of many NLP experts is to try TextRank or RAKE. If you want to expand your tool-set when doing keyword extraction, YAKE is a great way to get keywords quickly and without any training of ML models from any document. The repository also gives a really great overview of similar keyword extraction algorithms. Give it a try.

#### Spotlight №3
Transfer Learning library for NLP called FARM: https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM

FARM builds upon the very successful Transformers package (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from Hugging Face and incorporates many existing models like BERT or XLNet. With FARM you can pre-train them easily for any downstream NLP tasks. FARM is great for some fast prototyping and proof-of-concept to show your PM that transfer learning is the way to go.
